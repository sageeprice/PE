This repository holds my solutions to ProjectEuler problems. I was motivated to write it after realizing that I lost most of my old solutions, and thought it would be nice to start working through them again as practice.

Currently I am only working in Java 8. I will try to optimize solutions until they run in a couple seconds or less. Not gonna nitpick about being more performant than that on what is a fun side project for me.

At some point I may start writing up solutions to the more interesting problems, but until then there is sparse javadoc on some problems to explain my thought process.
