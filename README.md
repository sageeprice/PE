**PE = [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)**

This repository serves to hold my solutions to ProjectEuler problems. I was motivated to write it after realizing that I never uploaded any of my old solutions anywhere, and thought it would be nice to start working through them again as practice.

Currently I am only providing Java solutions, using JDK 8. I will try to optimize solutions until they run in less than a second. Not gonna nitpick about being more performant than that on what is a fun side project for me.

At some point I'll probably start writing up solutions on my [home page](sage-price.com), but until then there is sparse javadoc on some problems to explain my thought process.

You can find me on PE at [SageEuler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=SageEuler).
