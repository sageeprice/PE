     * Easy question so I'll give a quick explanation.
     *
     * This is kind of a classic problem. The easy way to
     * think about it is that you must take 40 steps. 20 of them
     * must be right, 20 must be down. So if we pick 20 out of
     * the 40 steps to be right, the others must be down, and
     * the selection of these steps uniquely determine the
     * route taken. The simple way to get this count is to
     * calculate n choose k.
     *
     * If we pretend all 40 things are unique, there are 40!
     * ways to order them. However, in our case they are split
     * into 2 sets of 20 of the same thing. So within our
     * ordering, any ordering of those 20 is equivalent. So in
     * total there are 20! ways to order each set, so we divide
     * our total by each of these sets of ordering. This leaves
     * us with the simple 40! / (20! * 20!), or 40 choose 20.
     *
     * This is easily generalizable for whatever grid dimensions
     * you want. The problem gets more interesting when you use
     * a non-rectangular grid or add holes in the grid, but the
     * problem can still be solved simply with a dynamic approach.
